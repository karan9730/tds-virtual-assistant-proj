A little more time will help us deploy properly as well.

Even when working in groups and mixing and matching code… the real messy work
is debugging and deployment due to the sheer variety of it. Some are deploying
on AWS, some on scalingo, some on Digitalocean, some on Render, some on Azure…
even helping amongst ourselves is getting complex because of this.
