It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal
question.
You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure
you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1
on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for
grading.
Kind regards
