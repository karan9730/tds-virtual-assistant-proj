Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns
include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series
ID and Item, I couldnâ€™t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could
someone please assist me with this?

industry data for the Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing sector. The
data is presented for two specific categories: "Anticoagulants, hemostatics,
and digitalis preparations" and "Calcium channel blockers." Each category
includes information such as Series Title, Series ID, Seasonality, Survey
Name, Measure Data, Industry, and Item. The data is indicated as "not
seasonally adjusted."
