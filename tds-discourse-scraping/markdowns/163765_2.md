Hi Shalini,
We are aware of the issue and [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) is working on a solution.
The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save
button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its
being fixed.
**The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last
submission contains all the answers for all the questions.**
Kind regards
