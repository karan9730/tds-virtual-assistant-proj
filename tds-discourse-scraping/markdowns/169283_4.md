I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:
    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
    kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    
And got the following output:
    
    
    Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04
    
Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.  
Image: Here are a few ways to caption this image, depending on the context:
**General:** * A selection of feature weights in a machine learning model,
with 'AvgDistance' currently selected. * Radio button choices for feature
weights, showing 'AvgDistance' with a weight of -0.05 selected. * Options for
feature importance, with 'AvgDistance' highlighted. **More specific, if we
assume context about model tuning:** * Tuning a model: currently, the feature
'AvgDistance' with a negative weight is selected. * Feature selection with
radio buttons, currently set to 'AvgDistance' at -0.05. The most accurate
caption depends on the situation you're using it in!
Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:
    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
    pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    
and got the following answers:
    
    
    Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08
    
The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and
Mileage).  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image, focusing on different aspects:
**Short and Descriptive:** * Radio buttons showing feature importance scores.
* A selection of feature importance values for a model. * Visual
representation of feature ranking with radio buttons. **More Informative:** *
A screenshot displaying the relative importance of features like mileage,
average distance, and engine capacity, likely from a machine learning model. *
An image demonstrating feature importance scores, where 'Mileage' with a value
of 0.24 is selected. * Radio button selection indicating that the 'Mileage'
feature (with a score of 0.24) is considered more important than other listed
features for a given model or analysis. The best caption depends on the
context where the image is being used. If you are presenting it in a report,
the more informative captions are better. If you're using it as a visual aid
for a presentation, the shorter captions might be sufficient.
