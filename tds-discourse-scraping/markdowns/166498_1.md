Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the emoji with its tongue
sticking out: **Short & Sweet:** * ðŸ¤ª * ðŸ˜œ * Silly! * Just kidding! **More
Descriptive:** * Feeling playful! * Oops, did I do that? * Having a bit of
fun. * A little goofy. * Don't take me too seriously! **Sarcastic/Funny:** *
"Oh, really? Tell me more..." * My brain right now. * Nailed it! (Maybe not.)
Hopefully, one of these works!
Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the
error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we
are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more
important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which
I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing
course
I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

**General/Simple:** * Just happy to be here! ðŸ˜Š * Feeling good! ðŸ˜Š * Smile! ðŸ˜Š *
Good vibes only. ðŸ˜Š **More playful/specific:** * Me when I finally get that
thing I wanted. ðŸ˜Š * Trying to be positive today. ðŸ˜Š * Me pretending to be okay.
ðŸ˜Š (with a touch of irony) * Smiling through the chaos. ðŸ˜Š I tried to give a
variety, depending on the tone you're going for! Let me know if you want more.

Issue:** A developer is working on a "Wiki Outline API" using ChatGPT-4o,
encountering a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'" error. They've
implemented a workaround for SSL configuration by using `certifi` and checking
the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable, hoping to resolve the issue. The
console output shows the traceback leading to the `ssl` import error within
the `anyio` library, used by the `starlette` framework. Despite the error, the
system reports "Run successfully" which might indicate a discrepancy between
the error reporting and the actual execution of the script.
