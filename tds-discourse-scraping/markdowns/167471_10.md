[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir  
Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and
submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure
if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.
I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email
later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I
was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised
my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if
my submission could still be considered
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the sad face emoji: **Simple &
Direct:** * Feeling blue. * Just not feeling it today. * Sigh. * Mood. **More
Expressive:** * When you realize Monday is tomorrow. * Me after seeing my bank
account. * When your pizza order gets cancelled. * That feeling when you have
to adult. **A Little Humorous:** * My face when someone says pineapple belongs
on pizza. * Trying to be happy, but... * Is it Friday yet? (Said with a very
sad face) I hope these help! Let me know if you'd like more suggestions.
Kind regards,
