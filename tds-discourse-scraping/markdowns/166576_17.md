[@23f1003186](/u/23f1003186) thanks again for flagging this. This is fixed,
too.
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the "folded hands" emoji:
**General:** * Please and thank you! * Fingers crossed! * Hoping for the best.
* In prayer. * Sending positive vibes. * Namaste. **Humorous:** * Please let
there be coffee. * Please don't let this meeting be long. * When you ask your
mom for something. * Me praying I don't screw this up. **Contextual:** *
(Depending on the context of the image) e.g., "Praying for a good game!" (if
related to sports) or "Keeping everyone affected in my thoughts." (if related
to a difficult situation). I can offer more suggestions if you provide more
context about where you plan to use this caption.
