Image: Here are a few captions for the image, playing with different angles:
**General/Neutral:** * A portrait of a man smiling, wearing glasses and a
purple shirt. * A man with glasses looking directly at the camera with a
slight smile. * Friendly portrait of a person in glasses. **Focusing on
Appearance:** * Portrait of a smiling man in glasses, sporting a neatly
groomed hairstyle. * A man with a warm smile and stylish eyeglasses. **If
context is known:** * [Name] ready for a video call/presentation. * [Name] is
always ready to help with a smile. I tried to make the captions as accurate
and objective as possible, given the information available.
