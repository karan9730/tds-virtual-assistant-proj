My evaluation log file is missing.  
The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.  
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop,
my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches
the image id given in the MAIL,  
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07
My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure
which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.

I am requesting to look into this case. I think there has been some mistake
somewhere.
