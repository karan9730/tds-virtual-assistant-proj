Mail I received Yesterday:  
Image: The image shows an email regarding Project 1 requirements and
prerequisites. The sender (presumably an instructor or evaluation system)
informs the student that they need to pass certain checks before their
submission can be evaluated. The email lists the following requirements: *
GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible. * GitHub repository has a
LICENSE file with the MIT license. * GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
* Docker image is publicly accessible. * Docker image uses the same Dockerfile
as in the GitHub repository. The email then presents the evaluation results of
the prerequisites: * Docker image present in Docker Hub and is public: PASS *
GitHub repo present AND public: FAIL * Dockerfile present in root of GitHub
repo: FAIL * MIT license present at root of GitHub repo: FAIL The student
needs to address the FAIL items to ensure their Project 1 submission gets
evaluated. They need to ensure their GitHub repository exists, is public,
contains a valid Dockerfile at the root, and an MIT license file at the root.
Previous Correct Evaluation Mail:  
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **Short & Informative:**
* Feedback on a Docker image submission, including evaluation results and
deadlines for reporting issues. **More Descriptive:** * A detailed evaluation
of a Docker image project, including log files, script attachments, and
information on the evaluation process. Students are given a deadline to report
any problems before the final score. **Focusing on key information:** * Docker
image submission feedback with evaluation files and a call to report bugs
before final scoring on Tuesday. **A bit more engaging:** * Got Docker image
feedback? Here's what you need to know: from performance logs to the final
marking schema. Don't forget to report issues by Tuesday!
Good Morning Sir,
This is my github repo: [GitHub -
kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1](https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1) ()You
can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also
present.)
I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but
the mail I got yesterday worry me. Sir, I have worked really hard for project
1. Please look into this matter.
