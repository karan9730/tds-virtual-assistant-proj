One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb.
So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and
evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your
submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in
the github present at the version before the 18th.
