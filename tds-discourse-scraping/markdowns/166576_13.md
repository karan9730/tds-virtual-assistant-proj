I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the
answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this
question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here,
however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public
forum.
Please consider my request and double check-

Thank you

task at hand: **Caption:** "ReceiptRevive Analytics faces a challenge:
recovering sales data from imperfectly digitized receipts. The task is to
parse truncated JSON data, specifically extracting 'sales' values from records
with missing 'id' fields, and calculate the total sales across 100 records.
This will demonstrate the ability to extract valuable insights from
challenging datasets and rebuild client trust."
