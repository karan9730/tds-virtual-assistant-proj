Could you please look into the above issue?
Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading
pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:
### **Grading Concerns**
**Final Course Score:**  
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F  
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)
From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely
difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:  
[What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE
exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-
of-impossible-roe-exam/99838).  
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly
impacting their overall scores.
Furthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was
provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as
the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a
result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.
### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**
  * Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals** , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
  * The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
  * The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.
### **Request for Improvement**
To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:
  1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2** , well in advance of the deadline.
  2. **More structured and accessible support** , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
  3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels** , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.
I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements
can be made. Looking forward to your response.
