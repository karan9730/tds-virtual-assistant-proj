I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my
email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which
is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and
threw the `exec format error`.
This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be
evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
