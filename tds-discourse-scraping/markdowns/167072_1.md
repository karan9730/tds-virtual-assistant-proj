[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir please help
When I am downloading the data folder after processing datagen.py , it is
trying to download in root folder and it is facing permission error . how can
we overcome this ?  
needs sudo permission all the timeâ€¦  
Image: The image shows a terminal window with the output of the `ls /`
command, which lists the contents of the root directory. The prompt indicates
the user is `vikramjncasr` logged in as `ANJANEYA` in the directory
`/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`.
