You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.  
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.  
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored
either!  
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.
Kind regards
