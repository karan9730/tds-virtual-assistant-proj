Image: Here are a few captions for the image, focusing on different angles:
**Simple and Direct:** * The letter T. * T on a green background. * Minimalist
T. **More Evocative:** * Green and T. * The beginning. * T for time.
**Conceptual:** * The starting point. * A fundamental building block. * Ready
to begin. If you would like, give me a specific theme and I will attempt to
come up with something that matches.
