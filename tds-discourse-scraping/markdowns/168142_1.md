Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created
soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover
these.
  1. Syllabus
  2. kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice
  3. I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time
  4. Any mock or resource to practice from?
  5. additional tips, if any
