shows the steps to add a license to a repository. Specifically, it highlights
creating a new file named "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.md" in all caps, and selecting
a license template by clicking the "Choose a license template" button.**
I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as `Licenese.md` but
standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).
