“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were
assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data
for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two
are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in
the dataset?
