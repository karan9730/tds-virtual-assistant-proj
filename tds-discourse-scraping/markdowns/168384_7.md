Image: Here are a few captions for the image of Luffy (from One Piece) wearing
his signature straw hat and raising his hand: **General/Enthusiastic:** * "I'm
gonna be King of the Pirates!" * "Adventure awaits!" * "To the Grand Line!" *
"Let's go!" * "I'm ready!" **Humorous:** * "Anyone got any meat?" * "I found a
new island!" (probably with food) * "Raise your hand if you love adventure!" *
"Me? I'm not causing any trouble..." **Specific to the Image:** * "Luffy's
ready for anything!" * "The straw hat says it all." I tried to include a
variety of tones! Which one do you like best?

They will be available after the live session has finished.
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of Luffy from One Piece, based on
his character and the partial view we have: **General/Humorous:** * "Me trying
to reach my goals." * "Is it adventure time yet?" * "Just peeking in to say
hi!" * "Ready for the next adventure! Who's with me?" * "Almost there... just
need to stretch a little further!" **Character-Focused:** * "Future King of
the Pirates!" * "I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!" (Classic Luffy) *
"Meat!!!" (If you want to highlight his love of food) **Context-Based (if you
have a specific scene in mind):** * (If he's looking up at something
difficult) "Challenge accepted!" * (If he's encouraging someone) "Let's go get
'em!" To help me give you the best caption, is there anything else you'd like
to emphasize about the image or the situation?

We will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1
Image: Here are a few captions for the image, keeping in mind it seems to be a
cartoon character, likely Luffy from One Piece, with a straw hat and possibly
waving: **General/Enthusiastic:** * "Adventure awaits!" * "Setting sail!" *
"Ahoy there!" * "Onwards to the Grand Line!" * "Let's go!" **Luffy-Specific:**
* "I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!" * "Meat!" (if appropriate based on
Luffy's known traits) * "Straw Hat Crew, let's go!" **Simple & Playful:** *
"Hello!" * "Hey there!" * "Having a good day?" I'd lean towards the Luffy-
specific captions if you know that the character is indeed Luffy from One
Piece. I hope these help!
