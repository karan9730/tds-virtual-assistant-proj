Same issue with me sir.  
This is how my dashboard looks like. It shows the same for week 2 as well.
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **Short & Informative:**
* "Screenshot of a graded assignment on an online learning platform." *
"Details for Graded Assignment 1, due Jan 26, 2025." **More Descriptive:** *
"A screenshot of an online course platform, showing details for 'Graded
Assignment 1'. Key information includes the due date, submission guidelines,
and troubleshooting tips for accessing the assignment." **Engagement-
focused:** * "Heads up for anyone taking this course! Graded Assignment 1
details are here. Make sure to note the due date!" **If you want me to focus
on a specific element of the image (like the troubleshooting tips), just let
me know!**
