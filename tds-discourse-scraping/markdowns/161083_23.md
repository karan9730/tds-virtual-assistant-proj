Hi manmeet,
I donâ€™t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours
of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and
visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student
developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits
such as cloud resources and domains.
I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces
works very well if you have good internet connection.
