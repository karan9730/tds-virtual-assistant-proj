Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the praying hands emoji:
**General/Literal:** * "Praying for..." * "Sending good vibes." * "Fingers
crossed!" * "Hopeful." * "Asking for a miracle." **Humorous:** * "Please, let
there be coffee." * "Manifesting a nap." * "My bank account needs this." * "Me
hoping this meeting ends early." * "Dear WiFi, please don't fail me now."
**Sarcastic:** * "Thoughts and prayers." * "Maybe this will help." * "All out
of ideas." **Other:** * "Thankful." * "Grateful." * "Sending you love and
light." I tried to provide a range of options depending on the context you
want to use the image in. Let me know if you would like more!
