Sir, I have attempted the graded assignment 2 and also saved it but my score
is showing as absent. Please look into the issue sir.

Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **General:** * A screenshot of
an online assessment or quiz platform showing the end time, score, login
information, and recent saves. * An exam platform interface showing the
results for a user. **Focusing on the score:** * Ended with a score of 0, but
recent saves show progress. * The pressure of a deadline! This assessment
ended with a score of 0. **Highlighting the "Recent Saves" section:** *
Tracking progress: A look at recent saves in an online assessment. * Recent
save history suggests the user was working to improve their score before the
deadline. **If you want a caption that feels slightly more
humorous/relatable:** * Story of my life: running out of time on an online
quiz! ðŸ˜¬ Ultimately, the best caption depends on the context in which you're
using the image.
