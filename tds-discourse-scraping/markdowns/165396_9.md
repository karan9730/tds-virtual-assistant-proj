Respected Sir/Madam,
I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO
option in the checkbox  
I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in
the assignment  
and if you wonâ€™t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Simple & Direct:** * Graded
assignment question and answer with feedback. **More Informative:** * Online
assignment with a question asking if the student has accessed the assignment
link. The submitted answer was incorrect. **Focusing on the Specifics:** *
Screenshot of a graded assignment question: "I have seen the Graded Assignment
1 available at this link and have attempted it." The correct answer is "Yes."
**Engaging:** * Oops! Looks like someone missed a question on their graded
assignment! Better luck next time! I hope these help!
