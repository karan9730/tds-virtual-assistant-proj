There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme,
which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15%
weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full
marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5
and GA6, which you can verify.
Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7.
If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be
communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as
students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.
I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should
be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if
GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to
attempt or review it accordingly.
**[@carlton](/u/carlton)** , we request you to kindly consider this matter. We
are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness
for all students.
