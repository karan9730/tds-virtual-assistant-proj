I have completed my allotted 3 peer reviews, I was wondering if it’s possible
to do more peer reviews for extra credit? I ask because all 3 of my allotted
peer reviews were empty submissions and I don’t feel like I actually did any
work
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the smiling face with a bead
of sweat emoji: **General/Versatile Captions:** * "When you barely pull it
off." * "That was close!" * "Nailed it...kinda." * "Phew! Almost didn't make
it." * "I did it! (But at what cost?)" **Funny/Relatable Captions:** * "Me
after faking being productive at work." * "When the teacher calls on you and
you actually know the answer." * "Successfully parallel parking on the first
try." * "Me trying to act normal after a near-disaster." * "When you realize
you sent that text to the wrong person...and they didn't reply." **More
Specific Captions (Context Depending):** * "Me after my boss asks if I
finished that project." (Work context) * "Me after running late but still
making it to the meeting on time." (Time sensitive context) * "Me after
pretending I understood what the professor just said." (School Context) I hope
these help! Let me know if you'd like more!
