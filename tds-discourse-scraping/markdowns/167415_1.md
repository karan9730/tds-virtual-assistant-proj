I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile
already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of
dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was
showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by
iitm.
Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in
github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect
the Dockerfile?
