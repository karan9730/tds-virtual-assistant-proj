Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation,
where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually
I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file
and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device,
it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-
requisites Can you please check this once sir?
My GitHub repository for Project-1: [GitHub -

Thanking You
Just attaching the mail I recieved.  
Image: Here are possible captions for the image, focusing on different
aspects: **Short & Informative:** * Email with TDS Jan 25 Project 1 scores and
list of evaluation files. * Project 1 docker image evaluation results with
links to logs and attachments. **More Detailed:** * Email regarding the
evaluation of a docker image submission for TDS Jan 25 Project 1, including
information about missing files, performance requirements, and links to
evaluation logs, script files, and more. * A detailed project evaluation email
outlining potential issues (MISSING files), performance expectations, and
links to relevant files for debugging and analysis, aiming to provide feedback
on docker image submissions. **Emphasizing the potential for issues:** *
Received an email regarding project 1 docker image submission with indications
of missing files and a call for feedback on potential discrepancies. * Email
notification stating "MISSING" files leading to a zero score, suggesting the
docker image was misconfigured. **I tried to balance accuracy and readability.
You can choose the one that best suits your needs.**
