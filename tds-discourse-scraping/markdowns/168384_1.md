Hello Sir,
I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs
scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or
if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be
able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.
Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings?
Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and
how the mock links will be shared.
Thanks and Regards  
Shalini
