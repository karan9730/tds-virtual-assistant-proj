I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still itâ€™s showing 0 on my dashboard.  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Concise captions:** * SQL
query for "Gold" type tickets. * Code for filtering "Gold" tickets, with 10/10
score. * Screenshot of successful SQL query for ticket types. **More
descriptive captions:** * A correct SQL query selecting rows where the 'type'
column (cleaned and lowercased) equals 'gold', demonstrating a successful
solution for identifying "Gold" type tickets. * Screenshot from an exam,
showing a successful (10/10) SQL query that filters for 'Gold' tickets by
cleaning the 'type' column and comparing it to "gold" in lowercase. The task
instructions are also visible. * A code snippet from an exam, featuring a SQL
query designed to identify "Gold" type tickets by normalizing the 'type'
column using LOWER and TRIM functions, with the result marked as correct
(10/10). I tried to consider the context (exam/assignment), the successful
result, and the details of the code itself when writing these captions.
