[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) I had made my submission for GA1
on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the
course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am
also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved,
can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.  
Image: Here are some possible captions for the image: **Simple caption:** *
Online assignment results and a question about submission evaluation. **More
descriptive captions:** * A student seeking help to get their assignment
evaluated, even though they forgot to click "yes" on a confirmation. * A
screenshot of a graded assignment with multiple attempts and a question
regarding the possibility of evaluation after accidentally skipping a step. *
A student's request for evaluation consideration after saving the assignment
score but failing to confirm completion through a "yes" button. **Caption with
a touch of humor:** * "Oops, I forgot to click 'yes'! Please, can I still get
my assignment graded?" ðŸ˜„
