Thank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project
in a public session as my **Azure API URL would be exposed** , and since it
incurs **costs per usage** , I need to keep it secure.
I’d prefer a **private meet** to demonstrate the project. Please let me know
if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!
