Image: Here are some captions for the image: **Short & Descriptive:** * Course
Card: Tools in Data Science. * "Tools in Data Science" course overview. **More
Engaging:** * Ace your "Tools in Data Science" course! All assignments on
track. * New course alert! Dive into "Tools in Data Science" and stay on top
of assignments. **Humorous/Relatable:** * "Tools in Data Science": Where all
assignments are worth 100 points... except when you miss a quiz. * That
feeling when you're crushing the assignments but forget the quiz... "Tools in
Data Science" course card. I think the best would be "Ace your "Tools in Data
Science" course! All assignments on track."
