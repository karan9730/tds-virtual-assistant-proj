Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI
GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over
the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab
    
    
    df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]
    
is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only?
but then this constituency is not availble after 1957
using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

[df_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)
Google Drive file.
then i used margin formula as
    
    
    margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100
    
using this i got answer for 1st question as
    
    
    YEAR                              1992
    AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
    WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
    WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
    WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
    RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
    RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC

    MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114
    
which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks
