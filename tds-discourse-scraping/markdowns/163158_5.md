I’m confused where exactly is the TDS course?  
Image: Here are some possible captions for the image: **Simple options:** * A
screenshot of a graded assignment on an online learning platform. * An online
course assignment overview. **More descriptive options:** * A graded
assignment screen with instructions and a due date on an online course
platform, highlighting potential access issues and student ID requirements. *
Screenshot of an online assignment instructions page, emphasizing
troubleshooting tips for accessing the assignment and the need to use a
student ID for evaluation. **Humorous option (if applicable to the context):**
* The feeling when you finally find the graded assignment and have to confirm
you've seen it and attempted it (before even knowing what it is).
  
Where are the weekly videos?  
Where and what is the assignment?  
I’m confused.
