# Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective
assignments
### Why?
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image of the red interrobang:
**Short and punchy:** * Huh?! * Seriously?! * What the heck?! * Mind blown?! *
Confusion overload! **More expressive:** * When you hear the most unbelievable
news. * My reaction to everything in 2023. * The face of utter bewilderment. *
Is this real life?! * Wait, WHAT just happened?! **Humorous:** * My brain
trying to process complex information. * When someone tells you pineapple
belongs on pizza. * Me trying to understand crypto. * The official emoji of
existential crises. I hope one of these fits the bill!
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the thinking face emoji:
**Short & Sweet:** * Hmm... * ü§î * Brainstorming. * Let me think...
**Humorous:** * Calculating... * My brain hurts just looking at this. * Trying
to adult. * Me trying to remember what I walked into this room for. *
Overthinking at its finest. **Situational:** * When the instructions are
unclear. * Me trying to figure out my taxes. * Debating whether to hit snooze
again. * Trying to solve this puzzle. * When you realize you forgot something
important. **Let me know if you'd like some more options!**
If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?
### Too many Questions for LLM
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the emoji with glasses:
**Short and Sweet:** * "Nerd alert!" * "Geek chic." * "Feeling smart!" * "ü§ì"
**More Descriptive:** * "Excited about learning something new!" * "Happy to be
a nerd!" * "When you finally understand a complex topic." * "Ready to solve
some problems!" **Humorous:** * "Me trying to look intelligent." * "Pretty
sure I know everything now." * "Book smart and proud!" I hope this helps! Let
me know if you'd like me to generate some more.

"Ready to learn something new!" * "Just aced my emoji exam!" * "Nerd alert!
But I'm loving it." * "When you finally understand that one thing..."
**Specific to a situation:** * "Me after finally fixing that bug in my code."

a good study session." * "Me when I've got all the answers." **Sarcastic:** *

lie) I think a good caption depends on where and how you're using the image!
