Image: Here are a few possible captions for the image: **Short & Sweet:** *
Recent saves and logout option. * Logged in and ready to reload. **More
Descriptive:** * A user's account page showing recent saves and the option to
log out. * The screen displays recent saved scores, all with a score of 6, and
a logout option. **Focusing on the context:** * Recent exam scores showing the
latest attempt counts as official. * Assessment platform with user account
details, recent saves and logout options. I think the best caption depends on
the context you want to emphasize. If you're talking about an exam, focusing
on the score and official score would be appropriate. If you're describing the
generic interface of a platform, a more general description is better.
