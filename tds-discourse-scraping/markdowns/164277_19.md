Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not
very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and _an example_ of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is
considered.  
Image: Here's a caption for the image: "Deliverables and notes for a coding
project involving GitHub, Docker, and AI Proxy, focusing on creating a
functional application and submitting it for evaluation."
Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.
So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to
the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It
should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work
anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you
achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container
according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this
crucial test.
