Hi, Iâ€™m unable to view assignments. below is the screenshot for your
reference.  
Image: The image shows an error message "This site can't be reached" on a
webpage. The specific site is "exam.sanand.workers.dev" and the error
indicates the connection was unexpectedly closed. The page suggests checking
the connection, proxy and firewall settings, and running Windows Network
Diagnostics. The error code is "ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED". There are also
"Reload" and "Details" buttons visible.
Please suggest me a way to view it. I have allowed third-party cookies as
well.
Thanks
