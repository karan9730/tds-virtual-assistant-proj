It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time
should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.
There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py
was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected
outcome.
The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation
guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card
number from the image is a sensitive information.
I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.
Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking
the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.

**Simple & General:** * Happy to be here! * Just smiling. * Good vibes only. *
Feeling cheerful! **A little more playful:** * This is my happy face. *
Smiling my way through the day. * Big smile! * When you get good news!
**Relatable:** * Me when the weekend starts. * How I feel after my first cup
of coffee. * Trying to stay positive. **To give you the best caption, could
you tell me the context in which the image is being used?**
