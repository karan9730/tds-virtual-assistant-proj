Hello,  
I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25.
Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to
solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the
solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to
solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing
submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to
the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?
