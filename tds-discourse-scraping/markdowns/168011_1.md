Image: Here's a caption for the image you sent: **"Troubleshooting Incorrect
Log Analysis Results: A Case Study in Web Request Metrics"** **Explanation:**
The image shows a problem related to analyzing web server logs to derive key
metrics. The user attempts to provide an answer regarding the number of
successful GET requests matching specific criteria but receives an error
message. **Here's why the caption captures the core idea:** *
**Troubleshooting:** The "Error: Incorrect Answer" message suggests a problem-
solving scenario. * **Log Analysis:** The context is clearly web server logs,
given the description of the log fields like IP, Request, Status, URL, etc. *
**Metrics:**The core question is asking for a calculation based on the log
data. * **Web Request Metrics:** This relates to understanding the behaviour
of visitors on the site.
  
It seems that the question in _Graded Assignment 5 for TDS_ is producing
incorrect results despite the same logic working correctly for other
variations of the problem. Please check into this question once as I have
cross checked with many of the students and chatgpt and all of us faced this
issue in this question. Thanks!

code to take reference from:
    
    
    import gzip
    import pandas as pd
    from datetime import datetime
    
    log_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz'
    start_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
    end_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()
    log_data = []
    
    def parse_log(line):
        parts = line.split(' ')
        log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S')
        method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])
        return log_time, method, url, status
    
    with gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:
        for entry in file:
            log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)
            if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:
                if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:
                    log_data.append(entry)
    
    print(f"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}")
    
ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there!

Squinting Eyes" emoji: **General/Straightforward:** * This is me right now. *
LOL! * Can't stop laughing! * That's hilarious! * Mood. **Sarcastic/Self-
deprecating:** * Me trying to be positive about [insert something bad]. * My
reaction to my own jokes. * Trying to laugh through the pain. * When life
gives you lemons... laugh until you cry? **Situational:** * When you finally
get the joke. * When your friend says something unexpectedly funny. * Hearing
gossip be like * when I remember that one embarrassing thing I did I'll let
you decide which best suits your situation!
