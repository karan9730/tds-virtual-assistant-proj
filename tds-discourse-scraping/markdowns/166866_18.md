and othersâ€¦
I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on
multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the
discussion:
  * We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.
  * All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)
  * Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)
  * We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.
All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above,
including the concerns mentioned by students:
**Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.**
Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section
and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an
overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both
sessions to see how we construct these requirements.
Kind regards  
TDS Team
