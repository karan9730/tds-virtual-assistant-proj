Sir,
The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail
that said that it was absent.  
Image: Here's a caption for the image: **A GitHub repository called
"tds_project-1" showing the files in the main branch. The repository contains
Python files like app.py, requirements.txt, and test.txt, as well as a
Dockerfile, a LICENSE, and a MIT LICENSE.**
  
Image: The image shows the results of a project prerequisite evaluation, where
several requirements were assessed. While the Docker image, GitHub repo, and
Dockerfile were all successfully found and deemed public, the MIT license was
not present, causing the overall prerequisites to fail and resulting in a
project score of 0. The image also includes a warning that the submission will
not get evaluated if the minimum requirements are not met.
Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!
