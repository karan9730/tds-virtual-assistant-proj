I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.
Image: The image shows an error message from Docker Desktop indicating an
unexpected WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) error. It suggests possible
solutions like shutting down WSL, rebooting the machine, or reinstalling WSL
and/or Docker Desktop. The error message also indicates an issue with
deploying WSL2 distributions, specifically that WSL2 is not supported. The
user is prompted to gather diagnostics and submit an issue if the problem
persists.
I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).
wsl --version
    
    
    WSL version: 2.3.26.0
    Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
    WSLg version: 1.0.65
    MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
    Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
    DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
    Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011
    
Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.  
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?
