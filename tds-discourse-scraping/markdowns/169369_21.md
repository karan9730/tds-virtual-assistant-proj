24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the
time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasnâ€™t sure if it
was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)
I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the
time limit.
My roll number is 24F1001631.
