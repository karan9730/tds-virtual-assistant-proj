For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or
flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the
dependencies are interconnected with their versions.
Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation
is fine.

Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the letter "S" on a brown
background: **Simple and Direct:** * The letter S. * S. * The alphabet: S.
**More Descriptive:** * A white "S" on a brown background. * The letter "S" in
a simple font. * A bold "S" against a brown square. **Humorous:** * "S" is
for...well, "S". * Just a lonely "S". * When "S" is all you need. **If you
want me to be more creative, give me some context or an idea of what you're
going for!** For example, are you using this for a specific project, or do you
want a caption with a particular tone?

Coming to your second question,
The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version.
But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s
project it’s better to use requirements.txt.

**If you want to be slightly humorous or suggestive (depending on context):**
* Time to spell something! * S is for... (then fill in the blank with
something appropriate!) I hope these give you some ideas!

The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version
is listed.
