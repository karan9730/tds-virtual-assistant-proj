Sir, I received the mail today -  
Image: Here's a caption for the image: "Results of a pre-requisites check
showing pass/fail statuses for Docker and GitHub repository requirements.
Checks include repository existence, public accessibility, timestamp, and the
presence of LICENSE and Dockerfile."
  
Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to
this reason before the deadline itself.  
Image: The image shows a message indicating that a submission on GitHub has
failed due to the following reasons: the repository could not be found, there
is no "MIT" license in the LICENSE file, and there is no Dockerfile in the
repository.
  
Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due
to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was
already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in
the google form that was provided.  
Image: Here are the file names and their corresponding commit messages and
dates: * `__pycache__`: Final Submission - 2 months ago * `venv`: First
submission - 2 months ago * `Dockerfile`: First submission - 2 months ago *
`LICENSE`: Create LICENSE - 5 days ago * `MIT LICENSE`: Rename LICENSE to MIT
LICENSE - 2 months ago * `app.py`: Final Submission - 2 months ago *
`requirements.txt`: First submission - 2 months ago * `test.txt`: First
submission - 2 months ago
  
Sir can you please check.  
Thankyou
