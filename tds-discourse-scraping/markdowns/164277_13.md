While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in
the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem
statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to
the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the
log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.
