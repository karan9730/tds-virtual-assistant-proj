Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **General/Informative:** * An
error message from ngrok, indicating a problem connecting to the local web
service on port 8080. * An ERR_NGROK_8012 error page, suggesting issues with
the ngrok agent's connection to the upstream service. * A troubleshooting page
for an ngrok error, with advice for developers and visitors. **More
Specific/Problem-Focused:** * Ngrok error: "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect:
connection refused". Is your local web server running? * "Your Service" is
offline! This ngrok error means the agent can't connect to localhost:8080. * A
connection problem between the ngrok agent and the localhost web server on
port 8080. Time to debug! **Humorous (use with caution, depending on
context):** * Ngrok says my service is dead. Maybe it's time for coffee. *
Ngrok Error: A reminder that even tunnels have traffic jams. The best caption
depends on the specific context in which you're using the image.
