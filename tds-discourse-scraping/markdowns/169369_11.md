I’m experiencing a similar issue, I attended and submitted the exam but it’s
showing absent. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Short and sweet:** * "Tools in
Data Science: NEW COURSE with your scores." * "Your progress in Tools in Data
Science!" **More descriptive:** * "See your scores for assignments and quizzes
in the 'Tools in Data Science' course!" * "Track your performance in the
'Tools in Data Science' NEW COURSE. Time to head to the Course Page!"
**Emphasizing the 'Absent' grade:** * "Tools in Data Science course with
assignment scores and a reminder to catch up on that Programming Quiz 1!" I
tried to create captions that are appropriate, engaging, and relevant to the
content of the image. Let me know if you'd like more options!
