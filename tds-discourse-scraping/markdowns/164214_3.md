Image: Here are a few captions for the image, playing on different possible
angles: **General/Neutral:** * "Intense contemplation." * "Lost in thought." *
"A thoughtful expression." **Humorous:** * "Did I leave the stove on?" *
"Trying to remember where I parked the car..." * "When you realize you forgot
to mute yourself on the Zoom call." **More intellectual/analytical:** * "The
weight of the problem is evident." * "Deep in analysis." * "Pondering the
implications..." To give you the BEST caption, it would help to know: * Is
there a specific situation you have in mind? * Do you want a serious or funny
tone? Let me know and I can refine the caption!
