Please check this fix. It may solve your problem.
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image, playing on different
aspects of the photo: **General/Neutral:** * Pensive gaze. * Lost in thought.
* Intrigued. **Humorous:** * "Did I leave the oven on?" * "Wait, what was I
supposed to be doing?" * "Trying to remember where I parked the car."
**Sarcastic/Witty:** * "My face when someone asks me to do free work." * "Me
trying to understand the latest software update." * "The look I give when
someone says 'Just one more thing...'" **More specific/depending on context:**
* "Analyzing the situation." * "Deep in contemplation." To give you the best
caption, I need some context. Tell me: * **What is the situation where you
want to use this image?** (e.g., a presentation, a social media post, a meme)
* **What is the general tone you're going for?** (e.g., serious, funny,
informative)
