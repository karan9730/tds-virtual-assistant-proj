Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation
Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA
(they take it as an elective).
So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S.
Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.
