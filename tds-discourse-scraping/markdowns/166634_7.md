Sir I am having trouble in q8 also whenever I am pushing commit in git hub it
was showing in GitHub repository but it is not working in git hub actions.  
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **Simple & Descriptive:**
* "GitHub Actions workflow runs for 'Daily Commit' on the 'main' branch." * "A
screenshot of GitHub Actions showing recent workflow activity." * "GitHub
Actions logs displaying the status of 'Daily Commit' workflows." **More
Informative:** * "Checking the status of GitHub Actions workflows in my
repository. Looks like there were three 'Daily Commit' runs." *
"Troubleshooting failed GitHub Actions: Reviewing the 'Daily Commit' workflow
runs." * "Monitoring automated builds and tests with GitHub Actions on the
'main' branch." **Focusing on the specific information:** * "Three Daily
Commit workflow runs in my repository showing one that failed 33 minutes ago,
and two that failed 4 hours ago." To choose the best one, consider the context
where you are using the image. Good luck!
