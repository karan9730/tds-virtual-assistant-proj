Respected Sir [@carlton](/u/carlton),
I realized there are still many topics to learn in order to complete the TDS
Course ( With an A or S Grade) as I have missed some questions (Couldn’t do
even after studying the videos ) .
Therefore wanted to learn and regardless of the scoring I still wish to
complete GA1 but, I see that I can’t access the questions anymore …
Is there any way to give the answers in the portal and check. I just want to
learn and test my knowledge
Thank You,
