Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **General/Neutral:** * "A
portrait of a man with glasses and a purple shirt." * "Headshot of a
professional man." * "A smiling man in glasses." **If you want to be a little
more descriptive:** * "A friendly face with a warm smile." * "Portrait of a
man with neat hair and a button-down shirt." **If you want to imply something
about his character/profession:** * "Confident and approachable." * "Ready to
help." (If you know the context implies he's a professional) * "An expert in
his field." (Similar to above) If you have any more context, I could tailor
the caption even more!
