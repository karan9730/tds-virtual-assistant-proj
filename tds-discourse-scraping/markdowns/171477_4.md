Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),
Iâ€™m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1
evaluation emails:
  1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
  2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository
Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Short & Sweet:** * Email with
Docker project evaluation results. **More Descriptive:** * Email notification
with project evaluation results, including file links and details about the
Docker image submission. **Informative, focusing on the content:** * An email
with the evaluation report for a Docker image project, highlighting potential
issues like missing files and performance concerns. **Humorous/Self-
deprecating (if appropriate for the context):** * Oh dear, the dreaded project
evaluation email has arrived. Fingers crossed no files are MISSING! I tried to
cover a few different angles, depending on what you want to emphasize. Let me
know if you'd like more options!
  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image, focusing on different aspects:
**Short & Informative:** * Email showing a failed project submission due to
missing prerequisites. **More Detailed:** * An email notification detailing a
failed Project 1 submission. Prerequisites were not met, including missing
Dockerfile and MIT license. **Emphasizing the Negative Outcome:** * Received a
discouraging email: Project 1 submission failed due to several unmet
prerequisites. **If you'd like I can also create captions that are humorous or
focused on certain parts of the image.**
My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)
Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission
will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification
would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and assistance!
