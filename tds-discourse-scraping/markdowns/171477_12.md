Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my
DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and
the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **Short & Sweet:** *
Docker build and run log showing successful deployment. * Uvicorn application
successfully running in Docker. **More Descriptive:** * Terminal output of a
Docker build process, followed by a Docker run command that successfully
starts a Uvicorn application. * A development workflow: Docker build process,
followed by running the built image with Uvicorn, showing the application is
accessible on port 8000. **Technical:** * Docker image build details and
successful Uvicorn startup log. * Console output showing Docker image
creation, pushing to a registry, and running the built image with Uvicorn.
**If you want it more tailored to a specific scenario, let me know what you
are trying to convey!**
Sir, But I couldnâ€™t run the last command you gave,
    
    
    uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000
    
As I dont have evaluate.py
But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.  
Please guide me after this sir  
Thank You So much sir
