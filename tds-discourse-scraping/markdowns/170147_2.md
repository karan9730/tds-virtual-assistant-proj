**General/Descriptive:** * "Raw power on display." * "A formidable predator."
* "Nature's fury unleashed." * "The face of dominance." * "Warning:
Approaching danger." **Humorous:** * "I said, NO MORE flash photography!" *
"This is my 'I woke up before coffee' face." * "When you accidentally step on
a Lego." * "When someone eats the last cookie." * "Trying to smile for my
dating profile." **Intense/Threatening:** * "You have been warned." * "Step
back... NOW." * "This is my territory." * "Challenge me, and you will regret
it." * "Prepare to face my wrath." **Creative/Figurative:** * "The embodiment
of instinct." * "A primal scream." * "The heart of the jungle beats with
rage." * "Untamed and unyielding." If you'd like, tell me what tone you're
going for, and I can create a more specific caption!
