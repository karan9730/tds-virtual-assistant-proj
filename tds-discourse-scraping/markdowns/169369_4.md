Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,
I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware
that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my
dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”
I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a
backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly
look into this and confirm?
Thank you
