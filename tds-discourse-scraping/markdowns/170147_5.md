Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton) and for addressing our
concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth
transition and improving the course experience.
The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to
the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the
course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help
us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.
We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1
results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in
the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the
maximum marks is 100.
Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the
solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project
2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would
be greatly appreciated.  
Looking forward to your response.
Regards,  
Lakshay
