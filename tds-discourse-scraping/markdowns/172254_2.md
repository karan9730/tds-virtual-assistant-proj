After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal
got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t
hurt him any further.
Image: Here are a few captions for the image, playing on different aspects:
**Serious/Concerned:** * "A tragic encounter: An elephant confronts a
bulldozer in a battle for its habitat." * "The relentless encroachment of
development: An elephant stands its ground against heavy machinery." * "This
image captures the devastating impact of human development on wildlife."
**Humorous/Sarcastic (use with caution):** * "Guess who's winning the 'man vs.
machine vs. nature' contest?" * "Someone's having a *very* bad day at the
construction site." * "Talk about elephantine road rage."
**Neutral/Descriptive:** * "A bulldozer and an elephant face off in an open
field." * "An elephant confronts a construction vehicle in what appears to be
a conflict over territory." I would suggest choosing a caption that is
appropriate for the context in which you are using the image, and be mindful
of the potential sensitivity around wildlife conflict.
