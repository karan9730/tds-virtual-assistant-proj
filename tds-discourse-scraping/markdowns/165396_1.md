Hello,
I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not
see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and
attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

Image: Here are a few captions for the image, focusing on different aspects:
**Short & Sweet:** * Screenshot of an online platform, post-deadline. *
Account details and recent activity on a study platform. * Assessment history
and login information. **More descriptive:** * This screenshot shows the end
of an online task with details about past submissions and scores. * A user
interface displaying a logged-in account for an online study platform, showing
recent saves and their scores. * The online assessment period has ended, but
recent saves and scores are visible for the logged-in user. **Highlighting a
specific detail:** * "That 10 score though!" (If you want to highlight the
high score). * The deadline has passed, but past attempts are still visible. I
can generate more if you have a specific angle you'd like to take!
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Simple & Informative:** *
"Graded Assignment 1 - The assignment is past due and the first question was
answered incorrectly. The correct answer is Yes." **Slightly More Context:** *
"Screenshot of a graded assignment where the first question about attempting
the assignment was answered incorrectly ('No'), but the expected answer was
'Yes'." **Humorous (depending on the audience):** * "My current academic
situation summed up in one screenshot. Guess I haven't seen the assignment
even though I attempted it!" **Descriptive:** * "Screenshot showing a question
from 'Graded Assignment 1' about having attempted the assignment, with options
'Yes' or 'No'. The answer selected was 'No' but marked incorrect, with the
accepted answer being 'Yes'." I tried to provide a range of captions! Pick the
one that best fits your needs and the context where you are sharing the image.
