Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Short and Sweet:** *
"Assignment complete! ðŸ’¯" * "Nailed it! ðŸ’ª" * "Module 1 progress." **More
Descriptive:** * "Graded assignment results for Module 1: Development Tools.
Scored 100 and submitted on time." * "Overview of graded assignment with my
score, peer average, and median score." * "Successful completion of Graded
Assignment 1 in the Development Tools module." **Humorous (Slightly
Boastful):** * "Just casually acing Module 1. ðŸ˜‰" * "Setting the curve in
Development Tools. ðŸ“ˆ" I hope these suggestions help!
