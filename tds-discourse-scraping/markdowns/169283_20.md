My question 7 for GA6 is :  
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need
to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency
Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most
efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The
four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant
Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village :
(42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central
Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package,
calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs
Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance  
Whose options provided are :  
10418 meters
12287 meters
10965 meters
11149 meters
However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873
meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)
I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit
shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)  
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination
from central command post)
