Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **Short and
Descriptive:** * Screenshot of a TDS exam practice question on the Haversine
formula. * Working through TDS questions, using the Haversine formula for
distance calculation. * Studying for a TDS exam with questions on distance
calculation using the Haversine formula. **More Informative:** * Practice TDS
exam question involving the Haversine formula. The question simulates a
conversation between a student and ChatGPT to solve the problem. * Screenshot
from an online TDS exam practice platform. The question requires the user to
calculate distances using the Haversine formula, presented as a student-
ChatGPT interaction. **Humorous:** * Me trying to figure out the Haversine
formula for my TDS exam... looks like I might need ChatGPT! * The Haversine
formula: my brain's worst nightmare during this TDS exam practice! I tried to
focus on the key elements of the image: the TDS exam context, the Haversine
formula, and the problem setup.
  
Image: Certainly! Here are a few caption options for the image: **Option 1
(Informative):** "Working through a TDS exam using the Haversine formula!
ChatGPT's breakdown of the steps is coming in handy." **Option 2 (Question-
focused):** "Double-checking these coordinate conversions with ChatGPT. Does
this look correct? ðŸ¤”" **Option 3 (Humorous):** "ChatGPT is my study buddy
tonight! Let's hope my Haversine formula game is strong. ðŸ’ª" **Option 4 (Simple
and Direct):** "TDS exam prep with a little help from AI."
  
Image: Here are a few possible captions for the image, focusing on different
aspects: **Short & Descriptive:** * A multiple-choice question on calculating
distance using the Haversine formula, found on a quiz practice website. **More
Informative:** * A screenshot of an online exam question asking to calculate
the distance between the Emergency Supply Center and Eastview Medical Center
using the Haversine formula, given the latitude and longitude coordinates.
This is part of an End Term Quiz on TDS (potentially Transportation and
Distribution Systems or a similar subject), with 40 total marks. **Adding a
bit of context (if applicable):** * Practicing for my TDS (Transportation and
Distribution Systems) exam with a challenging question involving the Haversine
formula. **Humorous (if you're struggling with the problem):** * The Haversine
formula and I are not friends right now. Send help (and maybe a calculator)!
This question is part of a TDS quiz. The best caption depends on where you're
sharing the image and the tone you want to convey.
  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Short and Sweet:** * "TDS exam
question: Which hospital is closest?" * "Distance calculation problem in a TDS
exam." **More Descriptive:** * "An exam question from a 'Tools in Data
Science' course, requiring calculation of distance between coordinates to
determine the closest hospital." * "A multiple-choice question from a TDS
(possibly 'Tools in Data Science') exam focusing on location analysis and
distance determination using latitude and longitude." **Humorous (depending on
your audience):** * "Trying to save lives in a data science exam! Which
hospital is closest? Time to dust off those distance formulas." I have based
the descriptions on the information in the image, assuming "TDS" is related to
the subject "Tools in Data Science".
This question is in 2024 Dec22: IIT M FN EXAM QDD2  
Can anyone tell how to solve this?
