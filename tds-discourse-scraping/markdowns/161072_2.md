Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the letter "S" against a dark
background: **Simple & Direct:** * "S" * The letter S * Letter of the Day: S
**A Bit More Creative:** * "S is for..." (followed by a word starting with S)
* "Just an S" * "The beginning of something..." * "Sleek S" * "Serene S" The
best caption depends on where you're using the image and what you want to
convey!
