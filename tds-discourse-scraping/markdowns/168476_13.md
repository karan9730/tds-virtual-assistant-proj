But still this is a huge Problem …
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the 😐 (Neutral Face) emoji:
**Short & Sweet:** * "Meh." * "Okay." * "Whatever." * "Indifferent." * "Just
here." **Humorous:** * "My face when someone tells the same joke for the tenth
time." * "Mood: Existential dread." * "Trying to decide if I care." * "My
reaction to unsolicited advice." * "When you're trying to be polite, but..."
**Descriptive:** * "Neutrality at its finest." * "Unimpressed and unaffected."
* "An expression of 'I have no strong feelings one way or the other'." *
"Holding back a sigh." * "Trying to be diplomatic." **Let me know if you'd
like me to try and tailor a caption based on a specific context!**
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of Hobbes from Calvin and Hobbes,
looking a bit sad or contemplative: **General/Slightly Sad:** * "Existential
tiger thoughts." * "Contemplating the mysteries of the universe... and tuna."
* "Monday mood." * "Just another day in the jungle (of my mind)." **More
Playful:** * "My brain is 90% Hobbes, 10% 'where are the cookies?'" * "Did
someone say naptime?" * "Too much thinking. Need more snacks." **Humorous:** *
"When you realize you have to adult." * "Me trying to figure out taxes." * "My
therapist says I need to embrace my inner tiger. I'm working on it." I tried
to capture the tone of the character and the comic. Which one is your
favorite?
