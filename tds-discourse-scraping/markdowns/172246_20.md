The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has
left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this
change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated
“best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about
transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic
assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a
fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course
coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated
on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and
academic integrity.
