Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link)
that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the
portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??
I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.
I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact
my grade particularly as of this course.  
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image
attached below I erred up with this submission  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Simple & Direct:** * "A quiz
question answered incorrectly. The correct answer was 'Yes'." **More
descriptive:** * "A screenshot of an online quiz question. The user answered
'No,' but the correct answer was 'Yes,' resulting in a score of 0." * "An
example of an incorrect answer on an online assignment. The question asks if
the student has seen and attempted the assignment, and the correct answer is
'Yes'." **Sarcastic:** * "Nailed it! (Not really.)" * "When you thought you
were right, but the online quiz had other plans." I hope these options are
helpful!
