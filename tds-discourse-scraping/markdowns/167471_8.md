Good Morning Sir,  
Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker
image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present
in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given
so many days to complete this project.
Looking forward to your reply.
Thank you
