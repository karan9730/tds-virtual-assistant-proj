Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team
that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly
then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.
Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter
or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is
unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30
mins.
