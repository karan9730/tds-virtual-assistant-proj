I would like to share that we have successfully completed **TDS Project 2** ,
solving **46/57** cases dynamically via **Azure after deployment**! We also
tested it with our friends’ **GA questions** , and it’s working as expected.
This project was a **team effort** by me and two friends [
[@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) and [@23f2004637](/u/23f2004637) ], and
we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.
I would love the opportunity to **demonstrate our project** to **TA and Anand
Sir** in a **Google Meet session** on **March 31st** (since I have OPPE on the
29th and 30th).
If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be
awesome! Looking forward to your response.
