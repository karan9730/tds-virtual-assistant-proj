Dear all,
I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in
Data Science * course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment
Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom).
This is the basic prototype.
This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for
Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for
educators.
A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)** , our course instructor, and
TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)** , whose guidance
on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project
possible.
I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:
  * Expand functionality and evaluation models.
  * Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
  * Improve documentation for broader accessibility.
The [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom)
is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating
with you all!
Update: here is a video explaining the process -
