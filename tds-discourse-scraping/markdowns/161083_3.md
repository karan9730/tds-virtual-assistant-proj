Image: Here are the bounding box detections: ```json [ {"box_2d": [93, 14, 173, 37], "label": "16"}, {"box_2d": [83, 47, 186, 235], "label": "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)"}, {"box_2d": [362, 14, 689, 977], "label": "Download q-move-rename-files.zip and extract it. Use mv to move all files under folders into an empty folder. Then rename all files replacing each digit with the next (i.e. a19b.txtbecomee a20b.txt)"}, {"box_2d": [362, 74, 557, 207], "label": "q-move-rename-files.zip"}, {"box_2d": [845, 14, 948, 711], "label": "What does running grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum in bash on that folder show?"} ] ```
  
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with
the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](/u/carlton)
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or
209 → 210 is not working
