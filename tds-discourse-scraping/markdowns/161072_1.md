I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.
The grading assignment indicates Iâ€™m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that
mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?
Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the
assignments and projects?
