[@Carlton](/u/carlton) With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick
suggestion.
I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending
TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend
focusing on for better returns?
Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important
topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?
