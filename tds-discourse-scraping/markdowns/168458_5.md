Just FYI the correct tag to use for Professor Anand of TDS is
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)
Also ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set
before the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme.
Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.
Kind regards
