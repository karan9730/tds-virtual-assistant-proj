## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
All the image ids we evaluated were what _you_ submitted to us. This is the
list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) as the
official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will
only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the
repos _you_ gave us.
For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We
will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker
repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No
other image id will be evaluated.

## Bug fixes
If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks
because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts
and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.
Kind regards,
