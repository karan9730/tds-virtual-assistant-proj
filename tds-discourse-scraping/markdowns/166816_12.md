Image: Here are a few captions for the image, focusing on different aspects:
**Short & Informative:** * Online exam interface: Score, time limit, and
recent saves. * Screenshot of an online quiz platform with a note about its
hackability. **Intriguing/Humorous:** * "It's hackable. That's allowed." A
very honest online exam interface. * The wild west of online quizzes: Hacking
encouraged, servers required. * When the exam admin is as tired as you are.
"It's hackable." **Descriptive:** * A student's view of an online exam
platform, showing their score, recent saves, and a login session. * A
screenshot of an online assessment, with a rather unusual disclaimer about the
quiz's vulnerability. I tried to focus on the most relevant/unusual aspects in
the captions.
