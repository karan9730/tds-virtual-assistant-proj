[@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382) \- The topics & resources that might help prepare
for the projects at <https://tds.s-anand.net/>. It’s an evolving site. We keep
adding whatever’s required that’s (a) new or (b) unknown to some students.
Please go through the content. Where you find gaps, please let us know. If
it’s a need across multiple students, we’ll find / create the content around
it.
Looking forward to your project!
