## Important Instruction
Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: [Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks).
A friendly suggestion: kindly go through [Discourse Docs](/c/docs-
discourse/45)!
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image of the smiling emoji:
**General/Simple:** * "Just smile!" * "Happy vibes." * "Feeling good!" * "A
smile can go a long way." **More Specific (depending on context):** * "Me when
I finally understand the instructions." * "My face when the weekend is here."
* "Trying to stay positive!" * "Smiling through it all." * "POV: Your friend
just told a really bad joke, but you don't want to hurt their feelings." I can
provide more tailored captions if you give me more context about how you plan
to use the image.
