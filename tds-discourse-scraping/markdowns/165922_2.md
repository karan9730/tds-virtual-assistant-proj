Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when
working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts
between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main
reasons why you should use virtual environments:
  1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.
  2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.
  3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.

  1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**
• Good for quick experimentation and testing.
• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update
and break compatibility over time.
  2. **Using requirements.txt**
• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install
the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks
compatibility with another developer’s setup.
**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**
• If you **don’t specify a version** , pip install -r requirements.txt will
install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected
breaking changes.
• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)** , you ensure consistency
but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has
compatibility issues.
**Handling Version Conflicts**
• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version
constraint and reinstall.
• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:
• Using **greater than/less than constraints** : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows
updates but avoids major version changes).
• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.
**Best Practices Summary**
  * Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
  * Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.
  * Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.
  * Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.
