Hello Sir/Mam,  
I had created this thread to inform that my marks for week -2 and week-4
graded assignment have not yet been updated and showing in the dashboard. But
I have attended it, Please resolve the issue and do the needful actions.
Regards,

Week -4  
Image: Here are some caption options for the image: **Short & Sweet:** * Bonus
points for engaging on Discourse! * Recent score updates. * LoggedIn at IITM.
**More descriptive:** * Reminder about bonus marks for participating in the
Discourse forum for IIMT BS students. Recent save history is shown. *
Information about bonus marks on Discourse, and your logged in status with
recent scores. * Participate in the Discourse forum to earn bonus marks. See
your recent score history. **A bit more playful:** * Time to level up your
score on Discourse! * Keep Discourse-ing! You're earning bonus points! * Your
Discourse engagement is paying off! Check your recent scores. I hope this
helps!
I canâ€™t be able to enclose another screenshot of week-2 ( marks-5) as I was a
new user.
