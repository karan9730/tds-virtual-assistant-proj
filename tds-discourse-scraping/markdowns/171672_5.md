Image: Here are the recent commits on a GitHub repository. On April 3, 2025,
the committer renamed License.md to LICENSE.md. On February 17, 2025, there
was an update to License.md, and on February 15, 2025, the committer updated
and renamed README.md to License.md, along with a project commit.
  
I submitted the project **within the deadline** , and I ensured that **all
requirements were fulfilled** , including correctly adding the MIT License
file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.
However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present,
and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status.
This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and
confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named
correctly.
Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-
project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all
the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into
this matter again.
Thank you for your understanding.
