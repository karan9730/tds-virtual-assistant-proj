Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my
DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and
the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below  
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **Short & Sweet:** *
Docker build and run logs. * Uvicorn server running in Docker. **More
descriptive:** * Console output showing a Docker build process and a Uvicorn
application starting. * Docker build logs followed by a successful application
startup inside a container. * A screenshot of Docker build and run process
ending in Uvicorn running on a specified port. **A bit more technical:** *
Docker build output with image layers being created and pushed, followed by
running the image with Uvicorn. * Terminal output showing Docker build steps
including copying files and running pip install and finally the running
container hosting a Uvicorn app on port 8000.
Sir, But I couldnâ€™t run the last command you gave,
    
    
    uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000
    
As I dont have evaluate.py
But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.  
Please guide me after this sir  
Thank You So much sir
