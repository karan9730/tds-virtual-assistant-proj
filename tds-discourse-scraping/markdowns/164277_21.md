You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.
Please note:
  1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
  2. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
  3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure: 
     * Your code gives correct results _reliably_ (i.e. try a few times)
     * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
  4. Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
  5. For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.
