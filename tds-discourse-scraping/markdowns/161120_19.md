[@Nelson](/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker
CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250
people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many
organizations have therefore moved away from it.
