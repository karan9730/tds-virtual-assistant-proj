[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading
process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and
others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand
analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access
them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit
of the grading exercise.
Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Requesting access to a Google Sheet. **More descriptive:** * "You need access"
screen in Google Sheets, prompting the user to request access or switch
accounts. * A user is prompted to request access to a Google Sheet they don't
have permission to view. **Humorous:** * The digital equivalent of knocking on
a Google Sheet's door. I hope these are helpful!
Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access
with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue.
what do we do?
Image: Here are the tasks to complete: 1\. Create a new blank Google Sheet
workbook, named ga.7.1.rollno (replace 'rollno' with your IITM roll number
excluding the domain). 2\. Share with editing rights to
se2002@study.iitm.ac.in. If you do not do this step first, on a blank workbook
we will not consider your submission.
