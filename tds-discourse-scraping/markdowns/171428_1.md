I am really facing difficulty completing Project 2 on time as we had our OPPE
exam yesterday, and the past week was dedicated to preparing for it.
Additionally, due to an unforeseen emergency, I was unable to write the ROE
exam, which resulted in lost marks. This makes it even more crucial for me to
perform well in this project to make up for it.
I sincerely request if it would be possible to extend the deadline by 2 days.
This would allow me to put in my best effort and submit quality work. I truly
value this opportunity and would be extremely grateful for your consideration.
Thank you for your time and understanding.
