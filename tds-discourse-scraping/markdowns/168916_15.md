Image: The image shows a table with information about different projects or
files, likely related to software development. The columns are: a numerical
ID, email (likely the project owner), URL (of the project or file), result
(either OK or FAIL), type (like Docker, Repo, License, Dockerfile, Clone), and
message (describing the result, like "No public DockerHub image," "exists,"
"LICENSE," "No Dockerfile," "Cloned"). Several email addresses are listed, all
following a similar format, and most of the URLs are GitHub links to a project
named "Project-1." The results indicate a mix of successful and failed
operations, with the messages providing further context about the nature of
the successes and failures.
