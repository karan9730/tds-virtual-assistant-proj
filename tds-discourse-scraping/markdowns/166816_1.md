Image: Certainly! Here's a caption for the image: **The IIT Madras course
platform displays the Graded Assignment 2, with a notification indicating that
the due date has passed. Despite the deadline, the system allows multiple
submissions before the due date, with the final submission being graded.
Important instructions are provided, including the use of a student ID and
recommendations for disabling ad blockers and using Chrome for optimal
access.**
  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Short & Informative:** *
"Online assessment interface, likely week 2 of a course or program." *
"Screenshot of a completed online assignment, with a score history." **More
Descriptive:** * "A student's view of an online assignment interface, showing
completion details, score, and a link to a discussion forum. The assignment is
likely for week 2 of the course." * "Screenshot of an online learning platform
interface, showing the end date, score history, and login information. The
handwritten 'week 2' suggests the current module or focus." **Funny or
Engaging (use sparingly):** * "Final score? Let's not talk about it... But
hey, at least it's Week 2!" (If the low score is intended to be humorous) **If
you want a specific tone or focus, please provide more context, and I can
generate more suitable captions!**
this is for week 4  
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Short & to the point:** * "The
due date for Graded Assignment 4 has passed." * "Access issues with Graded
Assignment 4? Check these tips!" **More descriptive:** * "Graded Assignment 4
instructions and troubleshooting tips for accessibility problems. Note the due
date has passed." * "Having trouble accessing Graded Assignment 4? This
screenshot highlights potential causes and a reminder that the submission
deadline has already passed." **Focus on the student ID:** * "Don't forget to
use your Student ID to access Graded Assignment 4! (Even though the due date
has passed.)" **A bit humorous:** * "Oops! Too late for Graded Assignment 4.
Maybe these tips will help for the next one!" I hope these help!

Discourse! * IITM BS Week 4 - Time to earn that bonus! **You can also add a
personal touch based on the handwriting, like:** * Week 4 doodle on an

image and what you want to convey.
