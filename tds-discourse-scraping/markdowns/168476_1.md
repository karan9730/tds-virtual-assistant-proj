Dear [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Anand](/u/anand) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi)
First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in
supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have
been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning
experience.
However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges
in keeping up with the course expectations.
## **Key Challenges Faced**
###

art: **Short & Sweet:** * Blue gem. * Pixel Diamond. * Shiny Blue.
**Descriptive:** * A pixelated blue gem shimmering in the dark. * A retro-
style blue diamond sprite. * A low-resolution blue gem icon.
**Creative/Humorous:** * "Level Up!" * My Minecraft fortune is looking good! *
The key to unlocking the next level. Let me know if you'd like me to come up
with more options!
**Lack of Prerequisites**
This course did not list any **prerequisites** , leading many
students—including those from **non-technical backgrounds** —to enroll with
the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the
**course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than
anticipated, making it difficult to manage.

**Short & Sweet:** * Shiny! * Blue gem. * Pixel diamond. **Descriptive:** * A
small, stylized blue diamond. * 8-bit diamond icon. * A gem in pixel art
style. **Humorous:** * My fortune in the metaverse. * Diamonds are a coder's
best friend. * Is this worth anything? **If it's from a game:** * Gotta
collect them all! * +1 Diamond I can provide more options if you give me some
context on where you found the image, or what you plan to use it for!
**Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure**
The **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us
to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite
putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them
successfully.

Sweet:** * Gem. * Blue Diamond. * Pixel Diamond. **Descriptive:** * A simple,
pixelated blue diamond. * Shiny, blue diamond. * A sparkling treasure.
**Game/Pixel Art Focused:** * Collectable item found! * Shiny loot! * What
upgrade does this unlock? **Humorous:** * Finally found my blue diamond in
Minecraft. * Is this rare? I hope this helps!
**Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback**
Many students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback** ,
which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has
been a tough transition—especially for **working professionals** and students
without prior experience.
###
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the blue gem: **Short &
Sweet:** * Blue Gem * Pixel Jewel * Shiny Diamond * Diamond **Descriptive:** *
A bright blue pixelated gem * Isometric blue diamond. * Simple Pixel Art: A
blue diamond. **Funny:** * My entire crypto portfolio right now * When you
find that one good thing in a sea of darkness. * This is what you get if you
find a blue diamond in Minecraft! **Let me know if you'd like me to try
generating more options!**
**Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**
While we have put in significant effort—spending **2-3 days on Graded
Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores—we still find ourselves **struggling
to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE** , which are significantly
harder than anticipated.
We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also
hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts
but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a
revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded
Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of
students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to
pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the
course.
We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we
are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the
grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that
everyone has a fair chance to succeed.
Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration
and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course
objectives.
