Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **Concise:** * IIT Madras
online exam schedule for March 2nd, 2025. **Informative:** * Schedule for IIT
Madras online exams on March 2nd, 2025, including Python A1, Python A2, and
Java. Access exam links on study.iitm.ac.in. **Descriptive:** * A screenshot
of the IIT Madras exam schedule page, displaying the course names, timings,
and exam links for online exams to be held on March 2nd, 2025. I think the
"Informative" option is a good balance of detail and brevity.
