Image: Here are a few captions for the image, playing on different aspects:
**General/Neutral:** * Headshot of a man with glasses smiling. * Professional
portrait of a man. * Portrait of a smiling man in a purple shirt. **Slightly
humorous:** * "Ready for my close-up... and spreadsheets." * "Just your
average coding ninja." **If you have any context about the person in the
photo, I can create a more specific caption.** For example: * If you know
their profession: "Meet [Name], our new [Job Title]!" * If you know their
personality: "Always smiling, even on Mondays." Let me know if you'd like more
options!
