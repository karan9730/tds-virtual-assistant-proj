Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **Simple:** * "Progress on the
'Tools in Data Science' course." * "Course grades for 'Tools in Data
Science'." **More descriptive:** * "Screenshot of assignment scores for the
'Tools in Data Science' course, showing grades for each week's assignment and
the first programming quiz." * "A snapshot of the grade breakdown for the
'Tools in Data Science' course, including weekly assignments and a programming
quiz." **Slightly humorous (depending on context):** * "My performance in the
'Tools in Data Science' course so far..." * "Analyzing my grades in the 'Tools
in Data Science' course. Some improvement needed!"
