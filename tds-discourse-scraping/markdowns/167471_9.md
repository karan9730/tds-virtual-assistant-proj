So the reason for the failure is:
You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main
instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)
Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements
and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for
students to make the necessary corrections.
Then once you realised your mistake, on **Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e
_yesteday_ , you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.
Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647,
post:1, topic:167471”]  
Image: The image shows the file structure of a project. The project contains a
folder named "LLM_PROJECT1", a folder called "__pycache__", and several files:
"Dockerfile", "LICENSE", "app.py", "datagen.py", "evaluate.py",
"requirements.txt", "tasksA.py", and "tasksB.py".
  
[/quote]
showing that your files are in the correct place.
We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the
deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.
Kind regards
