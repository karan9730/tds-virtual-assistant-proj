Sir,  
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’
on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and
because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the
16th of Feb itself).  
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole
reason i made that change on the 16th.  
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility
that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly
appreciate it.  
Thankyou!
