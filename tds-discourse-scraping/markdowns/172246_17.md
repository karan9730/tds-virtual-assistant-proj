Image: Here are a few captions for the image you sent, focusing on different
aspects: **Short & Poetic:** * Lost in the cosmos, found within. * Seeking
answers in the infinite. * Where dreams meet the stars. * Night's embrace, a
silent journey. **Introspective:** * Facing the universe, facing oneself. * A
moment of contemplation under a vast sky. * Finding peace in the face of
infinity. * The weight of the world, under the weight of the cosmos.
**Descriptive:** * A lone figure silhouetted against a celestial masterpiece.
* Watching the universe unfold, one soul at a time. * A night sky ablaze with
wonder and mystery. * A breathtaking panorama with a single, mindful observer.
**Which one resonates most with you? Or do you have a specific feeling about
the image that you'd like me to capture in a caption?**

There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme,
which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15%
weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full
marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5
and GA6, which you can verify.
Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7.
If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be
communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as
students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.
I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should
be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if
GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to
attempt or review it accordingly.
