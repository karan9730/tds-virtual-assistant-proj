Hi Hari,
The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with
perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science.
Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at
least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded
Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions
were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a
conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is
always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This
is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We
cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or
not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students.
The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and
well attended.
Have you watched this session in particular?
Image: Here are a few creative captions for the image, incorporating different
aspects of the visual: **Short & Catchy:** * Week 3, Session 1: Let's dive
into the data! * Session 1: Charting the course for Week 3. * Week 3, Session
1: Analyze, strategize, succeed. **Focusing on Learning/Content:** * Ready to
learn? Week 3, Session 1 is here! * Unlocking insights in Week 3, Session 1. *
Let's explore the data! Week 3, Session 1 is starting. **Emphasizing
Progress:** * Level up your skills: Week 3, Session 1. * Continuing the
journey: Week 3, Session 1. * Week 3, Session 1: Building on our momentum.
**More Descriptive:** * Week 3, Session 1 of our data-driven series. Let's
begin! * An engaging visual for Week 3, Session 1. Ready to learn and
collaborate? I tried to capture the tone implied by the colorful graphics and
the "session" format (likely for a course or workshop). I hope these work for
you!
If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just
introducing it
Image: Here are a few caption options for the image: **General:** * "Attending
a virtual meeting while showcasing my love for anime on my browser." * "Zoom
meetings and anime browser themes â€“ a programmer's life." **Humorous:** *
"Naruto is helping me stay focused during this online meeting...I think." *
"Trying to be productive while surrounded by my favorite anime characters."
**Specific to the content:** * "Discussing large language models and coding
projects, fueled by anime energy." * "Juggling meeting obligations with a
browser full of development resources." **You can also add:** * A personal
touch by adding a detail about the meeting or the background theme. * A
question to encourage engagement, like "What's your favorite anime
background?"
followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases
Image: Here are a few captions for the image: **General Captions:** * Learning
about data sourcing in an online course at IIT Madras. * A lecture on real-
life web scraping scenarios. * Data sourcing and web scraping lessons.
**Specific Captions:** * Exploring the "Optional: Real-life scraping" module
in a data sourcing course at IIT Madras. * The data sourcing module includes
controls for extraction area and data formatting in IIT Madras Online Course.
* Learning about extracting data from the web using Python's pandas package in
the IIT Madras Online Course. **Humorous Caption:** * Apparently scraping data
is "optional," but Carlton D'Silva looks pretty serious about it.
But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand
it? That depends on the student.
Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them
because only then can we address gaps in understanding.
Kind regards
