Hi Carlton,  
I am writing to confirm the basic requirements for successfully completing the
course.
As I understand, the criteria for passing are:
  1. Achieving a score greater than 40 marks in the graded assignments.
  2. Securing more than 40 marks in the end-term examination.
Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is accurate? Additionally,
please let me know if there are any other prerequisites to be met.
