The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one
concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts
and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short
time).
If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you‚Ä¶ past experience
shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome
without significant assistance from the ‚Äúhooomann‚Äù
Image: Here are a few captions for the image of the emoji with glasses:
**General/Simple:** * "ü§ì" * "Smarty Pants" * "Nerd Alert!" * "Feeling nerdy."
* "Book smart." **Humorous:** * "Me pretending to understand what you're
saying." * "My brain after one cup of coffee." * "Trying to look
intellectual." * "When you finally understand the meme." * "My face when I
remember something embarrassing I did 10 years ago." **Contextual (depending
on what you might use it for):** * "Getting ready to study!" * "Time for some
serious learning." * "Research mode activated." * "Let's get to work!" I hope
these options give you a good start!
So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up
everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration
with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet.
There is a reason for that. Its very hard.
There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to
combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the
dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain
some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.
