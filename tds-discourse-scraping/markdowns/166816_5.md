Can you check the dashboard now, Iâ€™ve been informed by operations that the
scores have been pushed.
GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual
(i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be
made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.
Kind regards
