Dear Sir,
I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the
ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.
I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing
this issue
Image: Here are some captions for the image: **Short & Sweet:** * "Logged in
and ready to go." * "Recent saves indicate progress!" **Descriptive:** *
"Interface showing recent saves and scores on an educational platform." *
"Logged in to my IITM account, reviewing past scores and recent saves."
**Relatable:** * "The anxiety of seeing your scores listed from best to
worst." * "Trying to improve my score on this study platform." I hope these
work!
